Python 3 interface to encode and decode GRIB and BUFR files via the
`ECMWF ecCodes library <https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/ECC/>`_.

Features:

- reads and writes GRIB 1 and 2 files,
- reads and writes BUFR 3 and 4 files,
- supports all modern versions of Python 3.7, 3.6, 3.5 and PyPy3,
- works on most *Linux* distributions and *MacOS*, the *ecCodes* C-library is the only system dependency,
- PyPI package can be installed without compiling,
  at the cost of being twice as slow as the original *ecCodes* module,
- an optional compile step makes the code as fast as the original module
  but it needs a recent version of *ecCodes* `>= 2.14.0`.

Limitations:

- Microsoft Windows support is untested.


Installation
============

The package is installed from PyPI with::

    $ pip install eccodes-python


System dependencies
-------------------

The Python module depends on the ECMWF *ecCodes* library
that must be installed on the system and accessible as a shared library.

On a MacOS with HomeBrew use::

    $ brew install eccodes

Or if you manage binary packages with *Conda* use::

    $ conda install -c conda-forge eccodes

As an alternative you may install the official source distribution
by following the instructions at
https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/ECC/ecCodes+installation

You may run a simple selfcheck command to ensure that your system is set up correctly::

    $ python -m eccodes selfcheck
    Found: ecCodes v2.14.0.
    Your system is ready.


Usage
-----

Refer to the *ecCodes* `documentation pages <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/ECC/Documentation>`_
for usage.


Experimental features
=====================

Fast bindings
-------------

To test the much faster *CFFI* API level, out-of-line mode you need the *ecCodes*
header files.
Then you need to clone the repo in the same folder as your *ecCodes* source tree,
make a ``pip`` development install and custom compile the binary bindings::

    $ git clone https://github.com/ecmwf/eccodes-python
    $ cd eccodes-python
    $ pip install -e .
    $ python builder.py

To revert back to ABI level, in-line more just remove the compiled bindings::

    $ rm gribapi/_bindings.*
